# A simple interpretation on the popular site 'Reddit'

## Introduction
The aim was to create a simple, modern, stripped down version of the 'Reddit' site using React. 
All data is collected from the reddit api, assets such as the icons are from https://www.flaticon.com/ and some images from the Reddit website.

## Design 
The design is focused on the idea of simplicity, bringing focus to the posts themselves rather than a tailored approach to the 'user'.
